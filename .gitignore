# Important: DO NOT ignore these files for Render deployment
# The vendor directory can be large, so it's typically ignored in standard Laravel projects
# But for Render deployment with Docker, it may be committed if needed
# /vendor

# Critical files for Render deployment - make sure these are NEVER ignored
# composer.json and composer.lock are essential for deployment
!composer.json
!composer.lock
